# ReinforcementLearning
Some of our group members are working on projects related to Reinforcement Learning.  Below are some of the projects.

## TTTplay.py
Andrej Karpathy's pong code (below) was the base for this.  However, instead of pong, we are trying to get the gradient poilcy algorithm working tic-tac-toe (TTT).  We are using the TTT simulation that is part of OpenAI's Gym/Universe miniwob platorm.  Various changes are being made (such as using softmax at the last layer) to get TTT working. 

## pg-pong.py
Trains pong using Gradient Policies, from Andrej Karpathy's gibhub (https://gist.github.com/karpathy/a4166c7fe253700972fcbc77e4ea32c5) with potentially slight changes due to Python version.  The logic behind this work is explained on his wonderful blog post at http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/ .
